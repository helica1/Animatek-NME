# Animatek NME Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally limited to real remaining implementation work. Completed features and
release history belong in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Post-0.18.0 Plan

The [post-0.18.0 development plan](POST_0180_PLAN.md) owns the detailed tasks,
evidence, dependencies and acceptance criteria from the September code review.
Patch version history and library tags are explicit priorities agreed with Javier.
Proposed release targets, not fixed dates:

| Target | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| 0.18.1 | Disconnect lifetime, safe backups, slot/document ownership, LOCAL isolation and coherent saves |
| 0.19.0 | Integration tests, asynchronous browsing, revision-driven persistence and session recovery |
| 0.20.0 | Patch history, versioned bank backups, library tags and favourites |
| 0.21.0 | Semantic comparison, content search/duplicates, diagnostics and grouped MCP operations |

Implementation has started with S1 (locally tested; hardware acceptance pending).
Track completion in that plan rather than duplicating
its checkboxes here. The MCP assignments item below remains the existing feature
definition; the new plan supplies its delivery and verification context.

## High Priority

- [x] **Module Icon Bar** ([#17](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/17)) —
  shipped as the module bar under the header: category tabs with the modules of the chosen
  category, dragged or clicked onto a patch area, hideable via View. Issue closed
  2026-08-09. The chips carry names rather than pictograms on purpose; the artwork is
  [#52](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/52), deliberately parked.

- [x] **Slot selection dialog on patch load**
  ([#21](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/21)) — shipped
  (`source/ui/SlotSelectDialog.h`). Issue closed 2026-07-24.

- [x] **MCP bridge: save, store and rename from a client**
  ([#23](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/23)) — shipped: `save_patch`,
  `store_to_bank` and `rename_module` all exist. Issue closed 2026-07-24.

- [x] **`replacePatchInSlot` read the patch it had just freed** — fixed. All four paths
  that destroy a patch (the synth fetch, `replacePatchInSlot`, `newPatch`, and the disk
  load) detached the Inspector with `clearModule()`, which keeps its own `currentPatch`
  and re-arms `assignmentsList->setPatchWide()` with it — the very patch the next line
  destroys. `clearSnapshots()` then walked that list and read freed memory; it survived
  only because the freed container's module slots read back as null. They now detach with
  `setPatch(nullptr)`, the only one that drops both pointers, and all four re-point at the
  incoming patch further down as they already did. The `clearModule()` calls that remain
  (`switchToSlot`, `prepareSlotModuleDeletion`, the selection change) are not
  detach-before-destroy: their patch outlives the call.

- [ ] **MCP bridge: no way to assign knobs or morphs from a client** — the editor has full
  hardware knob and morph assignment (`KnobAssignmentMessage`, `AssignmentsListComponent`,
  the Inspector's patch-wide assignments view), but none of it is reachable over the bridge:
  `McpRequestHandler` answers 16 methods and not one touches assignments, so an
  assistant that has just built a patch cannot finish the job by putting its most
  performance-relevant parameters under the front-panel knobs — the user has to do it by
  hand in the Inspector. Wanted: `assign_knob` / `assign_morph` / `list_assignments`
  (plus their removals), taking the same `section` + `container_index` + parameter
  name/id trio `set_parameter` already accepts, so a client can say "cutoff on knob 7".
  Both halves need writing: the method in `source/mcp/McpRequestHandler.cpp` and the
  wrapper in `mcp-bridge/server.py`, following the `set_parameter` pattern. Assignments
  are already part of the patch model and upload path (`buildHwFromPatch` reads
  `patch->knobAssignments`), so this is plumbing rather than new protocol work.
  **In progress (2026-09-13, branch `feature/mcp-synth-testing`):** `list_assignments`,
  `assign_knob`/`unassign_knob`, `assign_morph`/`unassign_morph` and
  `assign_midi_cc`/`unassign_midi_cc` are written on both halves, alongside read-back tools
  for hardware testing. Built and unit-tested (rules, event log, morph undo), and a first
  pass against a G1 the same day went through without a synth error (44 calls in a scratch
  slot). The box stays open until the result is also checked through the UI and on the
  front panel. Details: POST_0180_PLAN.md M1.

- [x] **MDI: the four slots inside the main window.** Done, unreleased. The per-slot OS
  pop-out windows are replaced by internal sub-windows in the central area, as the original
  Clavia editor and Nomad do. Each sub-window carries only its canvas; the Inspector,
  browsers, header and status bar stay shared and follow the focused slot.

  Tiling turned out better than the 2x2-plus-modes originally planned: it is dynamic, the way
  niri and Hyprland do it, so the layout is a function of how many slots are open (one full,
  two split, three in thirds, four 2x2) and re-flows as you open and close them. Plus a focus
  mode on F11 and on each sub-window's maximise button.

  It did what it was for: canvas wiring existed twice, inline in the constructor resolving
  through `activeSlot` and again per fixed slot in `wireSlotWindowContent`, with 19
  main-vs-slot-window special cases between them. There is one `wireSlotView(slot)` now, and
  `SlotWindow`/`SlotWindowContent` are gone.

  All phases and what each one turned up are in [`docs/MDI_PLAN.md`](MDI_PLAN.md). Two things
  are deliberately left out: the re-tile animation (not wanted) and an optional "Arrange"
  command for the manual Free layout.

  This superseded the old "slot windows: live fan-out and global commands"
  ([#22](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/22)) item, whose live fan-out and
  per-window `Ctrl+R`/`Ctrl+S` shipped in 0.11.0.

- [x] **Bank Upload from Synth** — implemented in 0.6.0 as "Save Bank to Disk" plus
  "Backup All Banks to Library" (Device menu). Position metadata is preserved in the
  `NN - Name.pch` filename. Verified against real hardware.

- [x] **Bank Download to Synth** — implemented in 0.6.0 as "Send Bank to Synth"
  (Device menu), folder source, overwrite warning, stops cleanly on failure.
  Verified against real hardware.

- [x] **Controller Snapshot** — implemented in 0.6.0 as "Send Controller Snapshot"
  (Device menu). Research against the original protocol resolved the scope question:
  the `SendControllerSnapshot` command (sc=0x55) asks the *synth* to emit the current
  values of the patch's MIDI CC assignments as CC messages on its DIN MIDI OUT
  (sequencer recording aid, same as the front-panel CTRL SNAP SHOT menu); it does not
  modify synth state. Verified against real hardware.

## Editor Workflow

- [x] **Keyboard Floater** — implemented in 0.6.0 (View menu): virtual keyboard with octave
  navigation, DRONE latch mode, and REPEAT pulse mode (Rate 100-500 ms, Gate 20-400 ms).
  Notes go through the editor protocol (Note command sc=0x56, `{onOff, note}` with 0=on
  1=off — captured from the original Clavia editor and hardware-verified; the PC port
  ignores plain MIDI). Stuck MIDI IN notes are out of the PC port's reach (NoteEvent is
  incoming-only, CC 120/123 ignored): that is what the front-panel panic is for.

- [x] **Knob Floater** — implemented in 0.6.0 (View menu): 18 knobs + pedal/switch/aftertouch
  with assignment LEDs and module/parameter labels. Knobs are interactive (edit + sync +
  undo, morphs included); right-click reassigns to a free knob. Also fixed the special knob
  wire indices (Pedal=19, After touch=20, On/Off=22; 18/21 unused).

- [x] **Patch Notes Floater** — implemented in 0.6.0 (View menu): resizable monospaced
  notes window bound to the active slot's patch. Notes persist in the `.pch` `[Notes]`
  section (a Nomad/nmedit extension; the original Clavia editor ignores it), so no sidecar
  file is needed.

- [x] **Window Management** — implemented in 0.6.0: main window size/position/maximized
  state persists (clamped on-screen if the monitor layout changes); floaters restore to
  the display they were last on, and resizable floaters remember their size.

## Search And Navigation

- [x] **Module Search Tags** — implemented in 0.6.0: hand-written tag table for all 110
  modules (`source/model/ModuleTags.cpp`, kept next to the descriptors without touching
  the third-party modules.xml), searched by Quick Add and the module browser filter.
  Quick Add ranks results by relevance (name prefix > name > full name > category/tags),
  and double-clicking empty canvas opens Quick Add like Enter does.

- [x] **Keyboard Shortcuts Audit** — done in 0.6.0: compared against the original
  nmedit/Nomad editor and added the missing set (Ctrl+A/X, Escape, arrow-key nudge,
  Ctrl+Shift+S, Ctrl+1..4 slot switch, S shake cables). Documented in
  [SHORTCUTS.md](../manual/07-shortcuts.md) and in-app (Help → Keyboard Shortcuts). The audit also
  surfaced and fixed editor-initiated slot switches not loading the slot's patch.

## Verification

- [x] **Input/Output Connector Verification** — done in 0.6.0 (results in
  `MODULE_CHECKLIST.md`): automated cross-check of theme vs descriptors. Structure and
  direction (circles/squares) correct across all 110 modules; 43 jack colors disagreed
  with their signal type and are fixed by coloring jacks from the descriptor signal,
  matching the cables.

- [x] **Release Checklist** — done in 0.6.0: see [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)
  (version bumps, build targets, no-synth smoke tests, hardware tests, packaging,
  post-release issue sweep).

## Reported Bugs

Tracked as GitHub issues; the detail lives there.

- [x] **Resource usage reads a flat 100%** ([#18](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/18))
  — already fixed after 0.9.0 and shipped in 0.10.0 (one-decimal Load meters); reported
  against an older build. Closed.

- [x] **Theme submenu checkmark sticks on the initial theme**
  ([#19](https://github.com/animatek/Animatek-NME/issues/19)) — fix shipped in 0.10.0 and
  the issue was closed 2026-07-23.

## Parked / Future

- [ ] **Community Patch Library — standby / decision pending**
  - No editor integration or release target is currently planned.
  - A private bootstrap repository exists at
    `animatek/Animatek-NME-Community-Patches`, with CC0 documentation but no patches.
  - Reassess the value, curation workload, submission flow, and maintenance cost before
    making the repository public or implementing downloads in the preset browser.

- [ ] **Plugin Productization**
  - VST3/CLAP targets currently exist but are experimental.
  - Architecture notes live in [PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md](PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md).
  - Treat this as a separate product track after the desktop editor is stable.
