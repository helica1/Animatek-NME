"""MCP bridge for Animatek NME.

Lets an MCP client add modules and connect cables in a *live, running*
Animatek NME editor - changes appear on the canvas immediately, and upload
to the real synth if one is connected.

This process is the actual MCP server an MCP client talks to over stdio; it
just forwards each tool call as one line of JSON to a tiny control socket
embedded in AnimatekNME itself (source/mcp/McpBridgeServer.h) and returns
the JSON response. AnimatekNME must be running, with the bridge enabled
